# **Description**
Simple and clean React gallery made with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), axios, and moment.js. CSS Modules and Sass are used for styling.

Design and functionality are based on the [Avito test assignment](https://github.com/avito-tech/safedeal-frontend-trainee) from the [Hexlet repository](https://github.com/Hexlet/ru-test-assignments) with tasks for practice.

To start project, use `npm i && npm start`.

## Functionality
This responsive gallery gets a set of photos from the server. Clicking on them, the user will open a modal with a big photo, comments (where available), and a form for adding comments. A new comment will be sent to the server. According to the task, it won't appear in the comments list, although I added alerts about success or error.
